# TTSTool
## What is it?
TTS Tool is a simple tool to create WAV audio files using Text To Speech.

## Why is it?
Because most free Text To Speech tools I can find online are closed source, poorly built and are outright sh*t.

## Why are they outright sh*t?
Because they usually only serve a purpose like only reading files, not outputting audio files, being severly limited in options, barely running, the list goes on and on.

## Can I use it?
Sure, just credit me if you do or something with a link to this repo.
